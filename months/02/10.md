## Hello, Monday! by *Scala*	
```scala
object HelloWorld {
	def main(args: Array[String]) {
		println("Hello, world!")
	}
}
```
Does it remind you of Java? [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) is kind of the Java of the functional world. It even compiles to the JVM. It applies a java-like object-oriented approach to functional programming.
