## Computer Etymology: Scala

Scala is a [portmanteau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of scalable and language. However if you look at the staircase in [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NVySmdAH4c) video of Martin Odersky, the creator of Scala and compare it to the logo the second meaning of 'staircase' orginating from Italian becomes clear. This is confirmed [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/250).
