## Z1

The 26th letter in the Alphabet is Z. It's the first letter of the last name of the inventor Conrad Zuse and the prefix for his machines known as the first computers. The Z1 was a mechanical computer that could do floating point calculations similiar to how computers nowadays calculate them electronically.

There is a [replica of the Z1](http://zuse-z1.zib.de/zuse-z1-pano/intermediate-view/) in the German technical museum in Berlin.
