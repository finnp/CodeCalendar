# Language of the month: C

THe language of this month is C. As we all know C is short for Coffeescript a language that compiles into Javascript.

Here is a C example:

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
 		int i;
 		for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
 		{
      		printf ("Hello World!\n");
 		}
 	return 0;
}
```

And this is what is compiles to in Javascript:

```javascript
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	console.log("Hello World!");
}
```
