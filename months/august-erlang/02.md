## Hello, World! of the Month: *Erlang*	
```erlang
	io:format("~s~n", [[72,101,108,108,111,44,32,119,111,114,108,100,33]]).
```
Looks fancy, doesn't it? Alright, it's a bit cheated. In Erlang Strings are nothing else than lists of Ascii values. So this weird list in the end we could also write as "Hello, World!"
