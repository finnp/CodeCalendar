<h2>What's up with J?</h2>

<p>Taken form the Wikipedia article about the language <a href="http://bit.ly/Lj0G0I">APL</a> the following expression generates a typical set of six pseudo-random integers ranging from 1 to 40, guaranteed non-repeating, and displays them sorted in ascending order.</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-text"><pre>    x[⍋x←6?40]
</pre></div>

<p>Crazy, right? And what does it have to do with J? Well as you may see, APL does have some weird symbols. Therefore traditionally you could need keyboards like this to write it:</p>

<p><a href="https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/4398cc3475012d18c034d26b69ea1a8af84ecf73/687474703a2f2f7777772e726578737761696e2e636f6d2f61706c6b6579622e676966" target="_blank"><img src="https://github-camo.global.ssl.fastly.net/4398cc3475012d18c034d26b69ea1a8af84ecf73/687474703a2f2f7777772e726578737761696e2e636f6d2f61706c6b6579622e676966" alt="APL Keyboard" style="max-width:100%;"></a></p>

<p>That's not very convenient. So based on the language APL, J was developed which doesn't need this kind of special characters. However I am not sure wheather it makes it easier. </p>

<p>I mean: Can you figure out what the following code written in J does?</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-text"><pre>    f =: (($:@(&lt;#[), (=#[), $:@(&gt;#[)) ({~ ?@#)) ^: (1&lt;#)
</pre></div>

<p>Yeah. Me neither.</p>
